# WinAutoSentinel Legitimate Services Whitelist
# This file contains patterns for legitimate Windows services
# One pattern per line, supports wildcards (*)
# Lines starting with # are comments and ignored
# Update this file to add new legitimate services or remove outdated ones

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:
# This whitelist uses broad patterns (e.g., "adobe*") to catch legitimate services
# from trusted vendors. However, malicious services can potentially spoof these names.
# Always verify suspicious services by checking:
# - Service binary path and digital signature
# - Service description and startup type
# - Online research of unknown services
# This whitelist reduces false positives but is not foolproof.
